# SOLID Principles

## What are SOLID principles and why do we use them?

SOLID principles are rules that guide developer to create maintainable & scalable flexible software.  
It consists of five principles:

S - Single-responsibility Principle  
O - Open-closed Principle  
L - Liskov Substitution Principle  
I - Interface Segregation Principle  
D - Dependency Inversion Principle  

---

### S - Single-responsibility Principle
The class should have only one reason for change and have only one responsibility.

---

### O - Open-closed Principle
The software entities (Class, function, models) open for extension and closed for modification.

---

### L - Liskov Substitution Principle
The class must be able to replace its parent without changing expected behavior and without breaking the application.

---

### I - Interface Segregation Principle
Clients should not be forced to depend on methods they do not use.

---

### D - Dependency Inversion Principle
High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules.  
Both should depend on abstractions.  
And abstractions should not depend on details — details should depend on abstractions.
